% This script was an attempt to find any pairwise correlations between the
% principal components of the high-throughput data, and the perturbations
% that produced that data. This doesn't work very well.
%
% This script is still useful because it compiles all the highthroughput
% data into the f000_*.mat files, which contain the relevant features of
% each dataset in a simple matrix format. This is used by later scripts.
